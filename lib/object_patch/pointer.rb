  # This module contains the code to convert between an JSON pointer path
  # representation and the keys required to traverse an array. It can make use
  # of an a path and evaluate it against a provided (potentially deeply nested)
  # array or hash.
  #
  # This is mostly compliant with RFC6901, however, a few small exceptions have
  # been made, though they shouldn't break compatibility with pure
  # implementations.
